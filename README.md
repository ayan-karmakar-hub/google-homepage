In this project, I replicated Google's homepage.

There were 3 main components: 
the header
the search area 
the footer

The most challenging portion for me was the search area, 
because it took me a lot of time to figure out the correct 
image size for the logo. It was also challenging to customize
the buttons during hover.

There were only a few instances where I needed outside help. 
One was for determining font family, size, and color by 
inspecting the original Google homepage. The other time was for 
looking up proper button syntax. 

On a couple occassions, I found myself stuck thinking I used a 
wrong variable name or didn't understand a concept when in reality
I had the right idea but simply made a slight syntax error 
(using : instead of ; at the end of a line). Overall, I am proud of 
how much of this project I was able to do unassisted.
